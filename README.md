# weather-today

I've used ipapi.co to get user's current location. After getting the location, I've used openweather.org api to get the city name, and the weather. 
And then, I've used different conditional statements, to check for the weather situation.
I had so much fun doing this project.
Things that I've learned:

1.Always go in layers. Always console.log the data.
2.use api which is https. I've to try 2 different api's for this mini project.
3.API documentation is so necessary.
